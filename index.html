              "Easy on Me" is a song by English singer-songwriter Adele released on 15 October 2021, through Columbia Records as the lead single from her fourth studio album, 30 (2021). Her first musical release in nearly five years, "Easy on Me" was produced by American record producer Greg Kurstin, who also co-wrote the song with Adele. It is a minimally produced pop ballad, set to a prominent, sombre piano, and propelled by sparse bass beats. Expressing themes of nostalgia, regret, and forgiveness, the song's lyrics represent Adele's plea to her son, in which she details her struggles with her dissolved marriage and requests him to be kind to her.
